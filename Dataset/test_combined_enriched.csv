The partnership will give VinFast access to selected workshops from Castrol's network of more than 750 Castrol Auto Service outlets in over 300 cities.</p>

<p>Under the agreement, participating Castrol workshops will establish VinFast-branded service bays staffed by certified EV technicians and stocked with genuine VinFast parts. VinFast will supply service manuals, diagnostic tools, training, and warranty coverage processes, while Castrol will ensure the workshops meet required infrastructure and capability standards.</p>

<p>The Vietnamese automaker recently opened its first overseas assembly facility in Thoothukudi, Tamil Nadu, with an initial annual production capacity of 50,000 vehicles that can be scaled to 150,000 units. The company has also partnered with dealer groups to establish 35 dealerships across 27 cities by the end of 2025.</p>

<p>Pham Sanh Chau, CEO of VinFast Asia, said the collaboration ensures customers will have access to service across the country. He stated the initiative aligns with both companies' commitment to supporting India's transition toward sustainable mobility.</p>

<p>Rajeev Govil, Senior Vice President of India B2B at Castrol India, said after-sales service will play a critical role in building customer confidence as electric mobility grows in India. He noted the company's experience in servicing conventional passenger vehicles.</p>

What’s the appeal?</p><p>‘Well, lot number 56 created quite a buzz, ladies and gentlemen … ” I’m sitting in a marquee in Chichester at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, sheltering from the summer heat. The auctioneer tells us that there have already been several telephone bids for this particular lot. Someone on the phone kicks things off with £180,000. The room holds its breath. Behind us are various astonishingly luxurious cars. One, an orange 1992 Mazda RX-7 FD Veilside Fortune Coupe, was used in the film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift. All of a sudden the bidding for lot 56 is at £220,000. Now £230,000. Now £240,000 from someone online. Now £250,000. I can hear the distant vrooming of race cars tearing around a track. But lot 56 isn’t a car. It’s a number plate.</p><p>Until recently, the UK record for a number plate sold at public auction was £518,480, set in 2014 when Ferrari dealer John Collins beat the competition to get his hands on “25 O”. Private deals have been done for millions of pounds. In Dubai, “P7” sold for £12m in 2023, setting a&nbsp;world record. Number plates can dwarf the value of the cars on which they sit.

This also makes Maruti Suzuki India's largest electric vehicle exporter.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Europe leads the charge in eVitara exports</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The first batch of made-in-India <a href=""https://www.autocarpro.in/news/made-in-india-suzuki-evitara-scores-four-star-euro-ncap-crash-test-rating-128515""><strong>Maruti eVitara</strong></a> SUVs, consisting of more than 2,900 units, was shipped to Europe and the UK. In total, 6,068 units were exported during August and September, with markets such as Germany, Norway, France, Denmark, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Hungary, Iceland, Austria and Belgium among the early recipients.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Exports mark a significant milestone for Maruti Suzuki, as the Hansalpur plant in Gujarat is the global production hub for the eVitara. The facility is equipped with a multimodal automobile cargo terminal with direct connectivity to the Mundra and Pipavav ports, ensuring efficient shipments to overseas markets. The Gujarat plant will also cater to the Japanese domestic market with made-in-India&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.autocarpro.in/news/suzuki-e-vitara-revealed-as-first-india-bound-maruti-ev-123366""><strong>eVitara</strong></a>, further underlining its strategic importance.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>&lsquo;Make in India&rsquo; showcase</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The export milestone follows <a href=""https://www.autocarpro.in/news/maruti-suzuki-starts-production-of-evitara-from-gujarat-plant-128238""><strong>Prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s visit </strong></a>to the Gujarat factory on August 26, where he flagged off production of the eVitara and lauded Maruti Suzuki as a &lsquo;Make in India&rsquo; brand ambassador. Suzuki has confirmed that the SUV will eventually be shipped to over 100 countries worldwide, positioning India at the centre of its EV strategy.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Built on the new HEARTECT-e platform, the eVitara is Suzuki&rsquo;s first dedicated EV, designed specifically for electric powertrains rather than adapted from ICE architectures. It will be available in single- and dual-motor configurations, including the entry level 49kWh single-motor: 142hp, the mid-spec 61kWh single-motor: 172hp and the top end model with 61kWh dual-motor: 178hp, 300Nm</span></span></span></p>

The brand has confirmed that it will showcase as many as five new models at the event, which opens its doors to the public from October 31 to November 9, with media previews scheduled for October 29 and 30. Staying true to its theme of &ldquo;The Power of Dreams&rdquo;, Honda says its pavilion will span everything from cars and motorcycles to aviation and marine innovations.</span></span></p>

<p><span>The headliner at Honda&rsquo;s stand will undoubtedly be the prototype of a new compact EV, engineered to deliver &ldquo;outstanding usability and the joy of driving.&rdquo; This yet-unnamed model is already in advanced testing stages, with prototypes spotted undergoing road trials in Japan, the UK and other Asian markets. Interestingly, this car could be the very same camouflaged Super EV prototype that was seen tackling the hill climb at the Goodwood Festival of Speed earlier this year.</span></p>

<p><span>That&rsquo;s not the only small EV Honda has lined up. The compact EV will be joined by the recently launched N-One e:, the all-electric kei car that carries forward the quirky character of the standard N-One which is a popular model in Japan. Additionally, Honda tuner Mugen will also display its own version of the N-One e: fitted with a range of optional styling and performance parts.</span></p>

<p><span>As far as SUVs go, Honda will showcase the latest gen CR-V e:HEV prototype, previewing the hybrid SUV&rsquo;s imminent Japan launch. Alongside it will sit the hydrogen-powered CR-V e:FCEV, underscoring Honda&rsquo;s multi-pathway approach to electrification.<br />
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Apart from these, Honda will also have the Japan debut of the 0 Series SUV and 0 Series sedan prototypes, offering a glimpse into Honda&rsquo;s next-generation EV strategy. There's also an all-new 0 series SUV expected to debut in concept form according to the teaser below.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
<span><span>Rounding things off will be the striking Acura RSX Prototype, a fully electric SUV that will make an appearance in a fresh new paint shade. Positioned under Honda&rsquo;s premium brand, the RSX is aimed squarely at buyers seeking both performance and luxury in their EVs.</span></span><br />
<br />
<span>While the line-up looks promising for global markets, the chances of these models making it to India are slim. Honda, however, is working on its first India-specific EV, codenamed ACE (Asian Compact EV), based on the Elevate SUV and due by 2026.</span></p>

The milestone comes as the Indian automotive industry experiences a dramatic reversal from August's GST-induced paralysis to September's renewed enthusiasm. The trend is also visible in retail sales, as <a href=""https://www.autocarpro.in/news/tata-motors-rises-to-no2-in-vahan-auto-sales-data-for-september-2025-128997"" target=""_blank"">reflected in Vahan data</a>.</p>

<p>Soon after GST 2.0 came into effect, Tata Motors recorded sales of nearly 10,000 passenger vehicles in a single day, supported by over 25,000 customer enquiries at its dealerships nationwide. GST reforms had reduced tax rates on small cars from 28% to 18%, effective from September 22, 2025.</p>

<p>In contrast, Tata's passenger vehicles division had slipped 7% year-on-year to 41,001 units in August, as widespread speculation about the GST cuts led prospective buyers to delay their purchases and dealers to cut back on stocking vehicles. Sales had slumped as speculation mounted that a mid-size SUV priced at ₹15 lakh could see potential savings of approximately ₹1.5 lakh under the new tax regime.</p>

<h3>Tata vs Mahindra</h3>

<p>While Tata Motors celebrated its overall monthly record, arch-rival Mahindra &amp; Mahindra wasn't far behind with its own impressive milestones. Mahindra reported its highest-ever monthly domestic SUV sales of 56,233 units in September 2025, marking a 10% year-on-year growth, with total vehicle sales (including three wheelers and exports) crossing the psychological 100,000-unit mark at 100,298 vehicles - a 16% increase over September 2024.</p>

<p>The comparison is particularly interesting given both companies' different strategies heading into September. While Tata saw its August sales drop by 7%, Mahindra experienced a steeper 9% decline to just 39,399 SUVs in August. Mahindra CEO Nalinikanth Gollagunta had explicitly stated that the company &quot;consciously decided to bring down the wholesale billing to minimize the stock being carried by our dealers&quot; - a more conservative approach that protected dealer margins but sacrificed August volumes.</p>

<p>However, Mahindra's cautious August strategy paid dividends in September. The company witnessed robust growth in customer retails during the first nine days of Navratri, with SUVs growing over 60% and commercial vehicles by over 70% compared to the same festive period last year. The surge in festive demand placed significant constraints on trailer availability, with Mahindra scrambling to improve dispatches to its dealer network.</p>

<h3>Across Segments</h3>

<p>For Tata Motors, the September surge was broad-based across its portfolio. The Nexon delivered a record-breaking performance with over 22,500 units sold in a single month - the highest-ever sales for any Tata Motors passenger vehicle. This compact SUV, perfectly positioned to benefit from the GST cuts, saw unprecedented demand as its effective price dropped significantly.</p>

<p>The Harrier and Safari SUVs achieved their best-ever combined sales, fueled by the newly launched Adventure X edition and multiple powertrain options. The Punch continued to expand its widespread appeal, further cementing its status as the popular choice among customers in the compact SUV segment.</p>

<p>The company's electric vehicle strategy proved particularly successful, with quarterly EV sales surging 59% year-on-year to nearly 25,000 units in Q2 FY26, recording Tata's highest-ever EV performance and contributing a record 17% to overall sales. September alone saw EV sales surge over 96% year-on-year to 9,191 units, while CNG sales reached an all-time high of over 17,800 units, reflecting a remarkable 105% growth compared to Q2FY25.</p>

<p>The August slowdown was particularly notable because it occurred despite favorable timing. The festival season &ndash; including both Onam and Ganesh Chaturthi &ndash; began in late August, about 10 days earlier than in 2024. Under normal circumstances, this convergence of festivals typically drives 15-20% higher sales, but the festival demand was completely overwhelmed by GST speculation.</p>

<p>The impact was felt across all major manufacturers. Maruti Suzuki's domestic PV sales had tumbled 8.2% to 131,278 units in August. Mahindra's August sales dropped to just 39,399 SUVs. Even the commercial vehicle segment, typically less affected by consumer sentiment, saw manufacturers pulling back on dispatches to protect dealer inventories.</p>

<p>Dealers reported a frustrating August, with showrooms seeing healthy footfalls but minimal conversions. Many customers who visited dealerships explicitly stated they were waiting for the GST announcement before making their purchase decision. Some even cancelled existing bookings, preferring to wait for the potential savings.</p>

<h3>GST 2.0: The Game Changer</h3>

<p>The GST reforms that took effect on September 22, 2025, represented the most significant overhaul of India's indirect tax system since the original GST implementation in 2017. The new structure simplified the earlier four-slab system (5%, 12%, 18%, 28%) into primarily two slabs of 5% and 18%, with a special 40% rate for luxury and sin goods.</p>

<p>For the automotive sector, the benefits were immediate and substantial. Small cars with petrol engines up to 1,200cc and diesel engines up to 1,500cc (both under 4 meters in length) saw their tax burden drop from 28% to 18%. This 10 percentage point reduction translated to savings of ₹50,000 to ₹150,000 depending on the vehicle's price, making cars suddenly affordable for a much larger segment of middle-class buyers.</p>

<p>Commercial vehicles, including buses, trucks, and three-wheelers, also benefited from the rationalized 18% rate, providing relief to the logistics and transportation sectors.</p>

<p>Despite the August hiccup, both Tata Motors and Mahindra demonstrated remarkable resilience in their Q2 FY26 performance. Tata delivered total sales of 144,397 passenger vehicles, registering a robust 10% year-on-year growth. Mahindra sold 145,503 passenger vehicles in Q2 FY26, up 7% year-on-year over Q2 FY25's 135,962 units.</p>

<p>The quarter also saw Tata's strategic expansion into international markets bear fruit, with exports to South Africa growing 5x compared to the previous year. Mahindra's exports contributed 4,320 units in September 2025, registering a 43% year-on-year growth.</p>

<p>Shailesh Chandra, Managing Director of Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd., noted that customer interest remained exceptionally strong, with new bookings doubling in the latter half of September following the GST rate reduction. &quot;With a strong booking pipeline, agile supply readiness, and rising demand driven by festive cheer and accessible pricing, we are well-positioned to carry this growth momentum in H2 FY26,&quot; he stated.</p>

<h3>Commercial Vehicles Join the Party</h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://img.autocarpro.in/autocarpro/24b1a816-b381-4272-bc9c-88c26d029c1a_Capturetgfeawraee.PNG"" /></p>

<p>The commercial vehicle segment also benefited from the GST reforms and improving economic conditions. Tata Motors' commercial vehicles delivered Q2 FY26 sales of 94,681 units, registering a 12% growth over the same period last year. September saw particularly strong performance in the SCV and pickup segment, which grew 30% year-on-year, driven by new launches like the Ace Pro and Ace Gold+.</p>

<p>Girish Wagh, Executive Director of Tata Motors Ltd., highlighted that September was the company's best-performing sales month in FY26 for commercial vehicles, with the GST reduction announcement prompting swift action to enhance product availability and sharpen pricing strategies.</p>

<h3>Festive Relief for Hyundai, Maruti</h3>

<p>Maruti Suzuki, still commanding roughly half of India's passenger vehicle market, achieved its best single-day performance in 35 years on September 22, delivering close to 30,000 vehicles after receiving more than 80,000 enquiries. Bookings for its small-car segment - the biggest beneficiary of the GST cuts - rose by 50% compared to typical festive trends, with dealerships extending hours to accommodate the unprecedented customer demand.&nbsp;Hyundai Motor India also posted its strongest single-day sales in five years, with around 11,000 dealer billings, reflecting the combined boost of festive sentiment and reduced vehicle prices under GST 2.0. The Korean automaker's recovery was particularly notable given it had suffered the sharpest decline among major manufacturers in August, with sales dropping 11.2% year-on-year to 44,001 units.</p>

<p>The September sales explosion appears to be more than just a one-month phenomenon. Industry data from the first nine days of Navratri showed passenger vehicle and two-wheeler sales jumping over 20% compared to the same period last year, though overall festive season registrations from Ganesh Chaturthi to September-end remained somewhat muted as many consumers had already made their purchases immediately after the GST announcement.</p>

<p>With the festive season in full swing, improving consumption patterns, and the full impact of GST reforms yet to unfold, industry experts anticipate sustained strong performance through the remainder of FY26. Construction, infrastructure, and mining activities are expected to gain momentum, further fueling demand for both passenger and commercial vehicles.</p>

<p>The psychological impact of &quot;government-driven discounts&quot; through GST reduction, combined with genuine price benefits, has created a powerful catalyst for demand. For middle-class families who had been deferring purchases, the combination of lower prices and festive sentiment has proven irresistible.</p>

<p>As India's automotive industry emerges from the GST transition, September 2025 will be remembered as the month when speculation gave way to celebration, and patience was rewarded with record-breaking sales across the board. For Tata Motors, achieving its highest-ever monthly sales while competing neck-and-neck with Mahindra's own record-breaking performance underscores the depth of demand that GST 2.0 has unlocked in the Indian market.</p>","Wed, 01 Oct 2025 14:59:21",month reporting soft wholesale numbers tata motors achieved highest ever monthly passenger vehicle shipments september delivering units including
