The updates may be subtle on the outside, but they bring some key feature additions and refinements inside the cabin.</p>\n\n<p>At first glance, the 2025 Thar looks much like the 2020 model as It continues with the same seven-slat grille which is now finished in body colour. The dual-tone bumper, which was introduced in the 2020 model but removed a little later, makes a comeback. Lighting remains unchanged with halogen headlamps and fog lamps, LED DRLs and LED tail-lamps. The SUV continues with the same 18-inch alloys wrapped in chunky 255-section all-terrain tyres.</p>\n\n<p>New additions include a rear wiper tucked behind the spare wheel and a camera integrated into the spare wheel cover. Mahindra has also added two new shades from the Roxx&rsquo;s palette &ndash; Tango Red and Battleship Grey &ndash; to the Thar&rsquo;s colour options.</p>\n\n<p>On the inside, The updated Mahindra Thar&rsquo;s cabin carries forward its all-black theme, but with several useful updates. The familiar dashboard is retained, though it now gets the Roxx&rsquo;s steering wheel and control stalks. An adjustable armrest with storage has been added to the centre console, and the power window switches have been relocated to the doors. Automatic variants now come with dead pedal, while an internal fuel-lid release has also been introduced replacing the one that opened with a key.</p>\n\n<p>Rear occupants benefit from AC vents, a Type-C USB port and a 12V socket. The A-pillars now feature grab handles for easier ingress.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest update is a 10.25-inch infotainment screen borrowed from the Thar Roxx, replacing the ancient 7-inch unit. It comes with wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, along with the updated Adventure Stats off-road telemetry. Other new features include a much needed rear washer-wiper and a rear-view camera.</p>\n\n<p>On the safety front, the Thar continues with dual airbags, ABS, ESP with roll-over mitigation, hill hold and descent control, ISOFIX mounts and a roll cage. Curtain airbags are still not part of the package.</p>\n\n<p>On the powertrain front, the entry-level 118hp 1.5-litre diesel (RWD only), the 132hp 2.2-litre diesel, and the 152hp 2.0-litre turbo-petrol continue as is. All engines are available with a 6-speed manual, while the larger two also get a 6-speed torque-converter automatic. Four-wheel drive continues to be offered with the bigger diesel and petrol engines.</p>\n\n<p>Mahindra says it has fine-tuned the suspension setup of the Thar three-door over the years to improve on-road comfort, while off-road hardware &ndash; including low range and a brake-locking differential &nbsp;remains unchanged.</p>\n\n<p>The facelift is aimed at keeping the 3-door fresh against growing competition in the lifestyle SUV segment, while also aligning it more closely with the newer Thar Roxx. Five years since the second-gen model&rsquo;s launch, the Thar continues to be one of Mahindra&rsquo;s strongest performers, having sold over 2.59 lakh units so far.</p>\n\n<div>\n<table

/>\n<strong>Building on Success</strong><br />\nThe refreshed Thar's launch builds upon a remarkable success story that has transformed Mahindra's position in India's lifestyle SUV segment. Since the second-generation Thar's introduction on October 2, 2020, the model has achieved unprecedented commercial success, crossing the 300,000 sales milestone by September 2025. This achievement represents a fundamental shift in the Indian SUV market, where the Thar evolved from a niche off-road vehicle to a mainstream lifestyle choice.</p>\n\n<p>The three-door Thar accumulated 225,709 units in sales over nearly five years, establishing a strong foundation for the brand. The model's success stemmed from its ability to balance authentic off-road capability with modern amenities, attracting both traditional enthusiasts and new buyers seeking distinctive vehicles. This dual appeal helped Mahindra create an entirely new market segment between utilitarian off-roaders and urban SUVs.</p>\n\n<p>The September 2024 launch of the five-door Thar Roxx marked a strategic expansion of the brand. In just 11 months, the Roxx variant sold over 71,000 units, quickly accounting for approximately 25% of total Thar brand sales. This rapid adoption demonstrated strong market demand for a more practical, family-oriented version of the iconic SUV while validating Mahindra's decision to expand the Thar lineup.</p>\n\n<p>The combined success of both variants has contributed significantly to Mahindra's broader performance. The company achieved its best-ever monthly sales of 56,233 SUVs in September 2025, with the Thar brand playing a crucial role in this achievement. The momentum positions Mahindra to potentially reach 600,000 annual SUV sales, a milestone that seemed distant just a few years ago.</p>", "Published": "Fri, 03 Oct 2025 13:30:54", "Clean_summary":

The 34% year-on-year growth over September 2024's 5,021 units marks the automaker's strongest performance in calendar year 2025, though it falls short of the record 7,516 units sold in December 2024.</p>\n\n<p>The company did not provide a breakdown of sales between internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and new energy vehicles (NEVs) in its September announcement, despite this split becoming a key metric in its recent monthly reports.</p>\n\n<p>According to VAHAN registration data, JSW MG Motor India sold 3,843 electric vehicles in September, down 24% month-on-month from August 2025's 5,079 units. This marks the company's lowest monthly EV sales in the past five months, though it secured a 23% share of India's electric passenger vehicle market for the month.</p>\n\n<p>The September EV figure suggests that approximately 57% of JSW MG Motor's total wholesale came from electric vehicles, with the remaining 43% from ICE models&mdash;a notably different mix from the company's stated target of 70-80% NEV sales. The company has publicly committed to this aggressive electrification strategy as price parity and lower operating costs drive mainstream adoption in India's passenger vehicle market.</p>\n\n<p>The September VAHAN data reveals a three-way competition in India's electric passenger vehicle segment. Tata Motors maintained its market leadership with 6,094 EV units, commanding a 40% market share despite an 18% month-on-month decline from August's 7,444 units. The recently launched Harrier EV has helped Tata Motors surpass 6,000 units for the third consecutive month, though the company faces increasing pressure from newer entrants.</p>\n\n<p>Mahindra &amp; Mahindra delivered 3,187 electric SUVs in September, down 14% from August's 3,699 units, capturing a 21% market share. The company's BE 6 and XEV 9e models, launched earlier this year alongside the XUV400, position it as the third-largest EV player. Mahindra's Chakan factory produced 4,921 units of the BE 6 and XEV 9e in August, its highest monthly production yet, suggesting the company is building inventory for festive season demand.</p>\n\n<p>The absence of an official ICE-NEV split in JSW MG Motor's press release is notable given the company's recent practice of sharing this data. In December 2024, the company reported that over 70% of sales came from electric vehicles, and similar figures were shared for October 2024, when NEVs contributed over 70% of the 7,045 total units sold.</p>\n\n<p>The September announcement only mentioned that &quot;both ICE and EV models&quot; contributed to the growth, without quantifying their respective contributions.</p>\n\n<p>The Windsor EV achieved its highest wholesale numbers since launching in September 2024. The model has established itself as India's highest-selling electric vehicle, surpassing the Tata Nexon EV, with 19,394 units sold in FY2025. The Windsor's battery-as-a-service (BaaS) option has helped JSW MG Motor make significant inroads into Tata Motors' traditional market dominance.</p>\n\n<p>The MG Comet recorded its best-ever sales for calendar year 2025. The company has expanded its portfolio with the M9 MPV and Cyberster electric roadster (priced at ₹72.49 lakh), both retailed through the new MG Select network, which became the second-largest brand in India's luxury EV segment according to VAHAN data. The broader portfolio also includes the ZS EV alongside ICE models like the Astor, Hector, and Gloster.</p>\n\n<p>The company attributed September's growth to favorable market conditions, including a GST reduction that translated into customer savings ranging from ₹54,000 to ₹3.5 lakh across its ICE lineup. The onset of Navratri festive season buying also contributed to the sales momentum.</p>\n\n<p>JSW MG Motor India operates as a joint venture between SAIC Motor, a Fortune 500 company, and JSW Group, formed in 2023. The automaker's Halol, Gujarat facility has an annual production capacity exceeding 100,000 vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>The September figures reflect the company's continued growth trajectory, though the gap between wholesale numbers (6,728 units) and retail EV registrations (3,843 units) suggests either significant ICE sales or a growing inventory of electric vehicles in the distribution channel&mdash;a metric that will be important to watch as the festive season progresses and the industry transitions toward electrification.</p>", "Published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 11:49:30", "Clean_summary": "jsw mg

The compact SUV has emerged as the Czech automaker's biggest success in India, partly due to its sensible market positioning and partly due to the overall demand for small SUVs in India.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.autocarpro.in/autocarpro/4f809307-00e5-48f2-ac33-bae3cf1a9f93_Screenshot-From-20251002-090215.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>This is despite the fact that Q3 sales have decelerated to&nbsp;10,786 units&nbsp;due to an overall slowdown in the Indian carmarket&nbsp;from Q2's peak of 13,509 units. Interestingly, Skoda Auto India's overall numbers are up&nbsp;110% year-on-year for the quarter, largely thanks to the Kylaq.</p>\n\n<h3>Industry-Wide Headwinds</h3>\n\n<p>After launching in January 2025, the compact SUV quickly became Skoda India's best-selling model by February. Quarter-on-quarter growth was impressive in the first half &ndash; sales jumped 32% from Q1's 10,205 units to Q2's 13,509 units, establishing the model as a genuine market disruptor.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;The period between July and September saw the Kylaq clock 10,786 units &ndash; falling short of Q2's performance, largely because of lower sales in July and August, which together accounted for just 6,476 units over two months. September showed a modest recovery.</p>\n\n<p>The reasons for the slowdown may have less to do with Kylaq and more to do with&nbsp;industry-wide challenges. The market was gripped by uncertainty and speculation regarding the proposed GST reduction on vehicles throughout July, August, and most of September. With buyers anticipating significant price cuts, purchase decisions were deferred across segments, leading to muted demand industry-wide.</p>\n\n<p>The GST reduction from 28% to 18% came into effect on September 22, 2025 &ndash; just eight days before the quarter ended. This timing meant that for much of the quarter,&nbsp;the market was in a holding pattern. Customers waited for clarity on pricing, dealers postponed promotional activities pending final rate announcements, and OEMs operated in an environment of uncertainty that made demand forecasting exceptionally difficult.</p>\n\n<p>Kylaq's rival Syros also saw a similar pattern. The compact SUV experienced an even more dramatic collapse during the same period &ndash; dropping from over 5,000 units monthly in its first quarter to just 774 units in June, 834 units in July, and 308 units in August. In the first eight months of 2025, the Kylaq sold 30,190 units, comfortably ahead of rival Kia Syros' 25,513 units.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This suggests the Kylaq's relative resilience, maintaining monthly averages above 3,000 units even during the worst of the GST uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the company is expecting to make up the slack in the coming days as the GST reduction made the Kylaq cheaper by up to Rs 1.19 lakh, with the seven-variant lineup now starting at Rs 7.55 lakh and extending to Rs 12.80 lakh ex-showroom.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The festive season, coupled with the simplified GST framework, has created a strong tailwind across the industry,&quot; said Ashish Gupta, Brand Director, Skoda Auto India. &quot;Our September and Q3 results reflect the strong customer response to our product portfolio, particularly the Kylaq, which has become a true growth driver for us.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Despite the quarterly hiccup, the Kylaq's importance to Skoda's India strategy cannot be overstated. At 65% of total sales, it has single-handedly transformed the brand's positioning from a niche player to a mainstream contender. By comparison, the Slavia sedan and Kushaq SUV &ndash; previously Skoda's volume drivers &ndash; together account for less than 35% of sales.</p>\n\n<p>The Kylaq operates in India's ultra-competitive compact SUV segment, which accounts for nearly 48% of the total utility vehicle market. Between January and August 2025, the compact SUV category recorded estimated sales of 892,057 units out of the overall UV segment's 1.85 million units. This makes it both the biggest opportunity and the most contested battleground in Indian automotive.</p>\n\n<p>The model competes not just against compact SUVs but also premium hatchbacks and compact sedans, targeting customers seeking a do-it-all family car. Its 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine developing 115hp and 178Nm of torque delivers a top speed of 188kph, while fuel efficiency figures of 19.05kpl in the city and 19.68kpl on the highway address the practical concerns of value-conscious buyers.</p>\n\n<p>Safety credentials have proven to be a strong differentiator as well. The Kylaq holds the distinction of being the best-performing compact SUV in Bharat NCAP tests with a five-star rating, scoring 30.88 out of 32 points in Adult Occupant Protection and 45 out of 49 points in Child Occupant Protection. In a market increasingly focused on safety, these ratings provide tangible reassurance to buyers.</p>\n\n<p>Skoda Auto India remains bullish about the Kylaq's trajectory despite the Q3 slowdown. The company expects sales to hit the 8,000-unit monthly mark by the end of CY2025 &ndash; a target that would require averaging approximately 7,000-8,000 units in the final quarter, representing a significant uptick from Q3's average of 3,595 units per month.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the GST reduction's full impact will materialize in Q4 as awareness spreads and inventory at new prices becomes widely available. The festive season &ndash; typically the strongest sales period for Indian automotive &ndash; is expected to drive footfalls across Skoda's expanded network.</p>\n\n<p>Production capacity has been ramped up to meet anticipated demand. The Chakan plant, which produces the Kylaq alongside the Kushaq, Volkswagen Taigun and Virtus on the shared MQB-A0-IN platform, is now geared to deliver higher volumes.</p>\n\n<p>As the festive season unfolds and the full benefits of GST reduction permeate the market, all eyes will be on whether the Kylaq can reignite the growth trajectory that made Q2 2025 its strongest quarter yet.</p>",

This market dynamic has been reflected in the slowed-down demand for e-PVs in September. </span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>September saw the addition to two new EV makers &ndash; Tesla and Vinfast India &ndash; who join the existing 14 players in the e-PV market. Between September 1-30, as per Vahan retail sales statistics (October 1, 6.30am), a total of 15,038 units were sold (this number will increase &nbsp;slightly as Vahan factors in additional new EV registrations for the last few days of September). While this constitutes strong 143% YoY growth (September 2024: 6,184 units), the fact is that month on month, September e-PV sales are down 18% on August (18,307 units) and by 8% on July (16,286 units).<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.autocarpro.in/autocarpro/310dbfab-6473-4adf-8c45-967eef4e3759_October-1--ePV-sales-for-September-2025.jpg\" /> </span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><em>While September 2025 sales of 15,038 units constitutes strong 143% YoY growth per se, month on month, they are down 18% on August (18,324 units) and by 8% on July (16,286 units). </em></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>As the 16 OEM-wise retail sales data reveals, there&rsquo;s plenty of red ink when September and August are compared. This is understandable as most of these OEMs have a good number of ICE models across the petrol, diesel and CNG powertrain spectrum and the GST cut, which has made most ICE cars, SUVs and MPVs more affordable has seen buyers flock to showrooms amidst the Navratri festival. </span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>Here's looking at the electric PV OEM performance in September 2025 and their current market share. </span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><strong>Tata Motors </strong>has delivered 6,094 units in September &ndash; down 18% MoM (August 2025: 7,444 units). This, nevertheless, gives it a market-leading share of 40% for last month. The recently launched Harrier EV has helped revive demand for the company, which has surpassed sales of 6,000 units for the third month in a row. And the Punch, Nexon and Curvv EVs continue to have a fair share of buyers. Tata Motors, whose EV portfolio also includes the Tiago and Tigor, has been impacted mainly by two OEMs &ndash; JSW MG Motor India and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, both of whom have launched new EVs in the past year. </span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><strong>JSW MG Motor India</strong> sold 3,843 EVs in September, down 24% MoM (August 2025: 5,079 units). This is its lowest monthly sales in the past five months but nevertheless gives it a 23% e-PV market share. The company, which has made inroads into Tata Motors&rsquo; market share with Windsor EV and its BaaS option, has expanded its portfolio with the <a href=\"https://www.autocarpro.in/news-national/jsw-mg-motor-india-confident-of-selling-1000-m9-electric-mpvs-in-first-year-127466\" style=\"color: #0563c1; text-decoration: underline;\">M9 MPV, which marks its foray into the premium EV segment</a>, along with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocarpro.in/news/jsw-mg-motor-india-launches-electric-roadster-cyberster-at-%E2%82%B97249-lakh-127702\" style=\"color: #0563c1; text-decoration: underline;\">Cyberster electric roadster</a>&nbsp;priced at Rs 72.49 lakh. Both models are retailed through the new MG Select network. JSW MG Motor also sells the ZS EV and Comet EV.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><strong>Mahindra &amp; Mahindra</strong>, which launched its two new electric origin SUVs &ndash; BE 6 and XEV 9e &ndash; earlier this year and also sells the XUV400, delivered 3,187 e-SUVs to customers last month, down 14% MoM (August 2025: 3,699 units). This performance gives M&amp;M a 21% market share for last month. </span></span><span><span>Nevertheless, the company is well primed to cater to festive season demand &ndash; in August, the <a href=\"https://www.autocarpro.in/analysis-sales/sonalika-tractors-records-highest-august-sales-with-10932-units-128464\" style=\"color: #0563c1; text-decoration: underline;\">Chakan factory manufactured&nbsp; 4,921 units of the BE 6 and XEV 9e</a>, which is the highest monthly factory production yet. </span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><strong>BYD India</strong>, the local arm of China&rsquo;s and the world&rsquo;s largest electric PV manufacturer ranked fourth on the e-PV OEM sales table, has bucked the overall slow-sales trend in September. The company, which sells the all-electric Atto 3 SUV, Seal sedan, eMax 7 MPV and the Sealion 7 SUV, sold 541 units in September versus 478 units in August 2025, up 13% MoM. This makes September the best month to date after May 2025 (531 units) for the Chinese OEM since it began e-PV sales in India.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>It&rsquo;s the same for <strong>Kia India</strong> which clocked retail sales of 499 units in September, up 8% MoM, and beating its previous best of 463 units in August. With this, Kia moves up to fifth position among the 16 EV OEMs and is ahead of Hyundai India. Put this down to demand for the recently launched mass-market Carens Clavis EV MPV. Kia&rsquo;s EV portfolio also contains the EV6 and EV9, which are imported as CBUs into the country and, as a result, are far more expensive than the mass-market&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.autocarpro.in/analysis-sales/carens-clavis-ev-powers-kia-india-to-best-ever-monthly-ev-sales-in-august-441-units-128320\" style=\"color: #0563c1; text-decoration: underline;\">Carens Clavis EV-MPV</a>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><strong>Hyundai Motor India</strong>&nbsp;sold 342 e-SUVs last month, down 45% MoM (August 2025: 618 units). Following the launch of the Creta Electric in January 2025, monthly sales had risen from 775 in February to 905 in March but since then demand has fallen for the zero-emission avatar of India&rsquo;s best-selling midsize SUV has been tepid. Hyundai also markets the Ioniq 5 in India.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.autocarpro.in/autocarpro/a14e7ffa-37be-41f6-85b4-1861817f12c4_Screenshot-20251001-at-9.39.33AM.png\" /></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><em>The eight luxury e-PV makers with 490 units accounted for a 3.25% share of the market in September. </em></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span><span><strong>LUXURY CARMAKERS SELL 490 EVs IN SEPTEMBER</strong></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>As compared to the mainstream e-PV market OEMs, luxury passenger vehicle OEMs have fared better.

The new Cayenne will go on sale overseas in 2026, with an India launch expected in the second half of that year.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>As with the latest Macan EV, Porsche has put technology at the heart of the Cayenne&rsquo;s interior. The cabin is dominated by a massive, multi-layered touchscreen setup that Porsche calls the Flow Display. Split into two distinct segments, the larger portion manages complex functions like navigation, EV drive settings and the newly introduced &lsquo;mood modes,&rsquo; while the slimmer section is dedicated to more frequently used controls such as media, calls and seat heating.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>Crucially, Porsche has retained physical buttons below the main screen and on the steering wheel for the most-used functions like audio volume and climate control. This mix of digital sophistication and tactile controls is aimed at balancing modern tech with traditional usability.<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.autocarpro.in/autocarpro/ee437161-abce-405c-add5-91c6aebce07d_CayEV1XX.jpg\" /></span></span><span><span>The Flow Display is supported by a 14.25-inch curved instrument cluster behind the steering wheel, and a 14.9-inch touchscreen for the front passenger. Like in the Macan EV, the passenger display can stream movies, play video games, and even run on a separate Bluetooth connection, independent of the car&rsquo;s primary audio system. This screen will be optional on lower trims but standard on higher-spec Cayennes. Cars without it will instead get leather or fabric trim matching the cabin upholstery.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>The innovation extends well beyond the screens. Porsche has confirmed that the Cayenne EV will offer close to 1,000bhp in range-topping guise, while also delivering an electric range of around 373 miles (600km) thanks to a large 108kWh battery pack. Charging technology is equally cutting-edge: the SUV will support 400kW DC fast charging for a 10-80 percent top-up in about 15 minutes. An inductive wireless charging system will also be offered for home use, letting owners recharge without a cable.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>With its blend of immense performance, cutting-edge charging, and Porsche&rsquo;s most advanced interior yet, the Cayenne EV is shaping up to be one of the most significant luxury SUVs of 2026.</span></span></p>", "Published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 13:09:54", "Clean_summary": "porsche officially previewed cabin upcoming cayenne ev ahead suv world premiere next month new cayenne go sale overseas india launch expected second half year latest macan ev porsche put technology heart cayenne interior cabin dominated massive multi layered touchscreen setup porsche calls flow display split two distinct segments larger portion manages complex functions like navigation ev drive settings newly introduced mood modes slimmer section dedicated frequently used controls media calls seat heating crucially porsche retained physical buttons main screen steering wheel used functions like audio volume climate control mix digital sophistication tactile controls aimed balancing modern tech traditional usability flow display supported inch curved instrument cluster behind steering wheel inch touchscreen front passenger like macan ev passenger display stream movies play video games even run separate bluetooth connection independent car primary audio system screen optional lower trims standard higher spec cayennes cars without instead get leather fabric trim matching cabin upholstery innovation extends well beyond screens porsche confirmed cayenne ev offer close bhp range topping guise also delivering electric range around miles km thanks large kwh battery pack charging technology equally cutting edge suv support kw dc fast charging percent top minutes inductive wireless charging system also offered home use letting owners recharge without cable blend immense performance cutting edge charging porsche advanced interior yet cayenne ev shaping one significant luxury suvs", "Category": "PV & EV", "risk_score": 0.4, "risk_flag": 1, "id": "4689847444d695195aa23a71984ae1375ad9fc42", "source": "https://www.autocarpro.in/NEWS/new-porsche-cayenne-ev-interior-revealed-with-brands-biggest-screens-yet-129007", "published_at": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 13:09:54", "title": "New Porsche Cayenne EV interior revealed with brand’s biggest screens yet", "text": "porsche officially previewed cabin upcoming cayenne ev ahead suv world premiere next month new cayenne go sale overseas india launch expected second half year latest macan ev porsche put technology heart cayenne interior cabin dominated massive multi layered touchscreen setup porsche calls flow display split two distinct segments larger portion manages complex functions like navigation ev drive settings newly introduced mood modes slimmer section dedicated frequently used controls media calls seat heating crucially porsche retained physical buttons main screen steering wheel used functions like audio volume climate control mix digital sophistication tactile controls aimed balancing modern tech traditional usability flow display supported inch curved instrument cluster behind steering wheel inch touchscreen front passenger like macan ev passenger display stream movies play video games even run separate bluetooth connection independent car primary audio system screen optional lower trims standard higher spec cayennes cars without instead get leather fabric trim matching cabin upholstery innovation extends well beyond screens porsche confirmed cayenne ev offer close bhp range topping guise also delivering electric range around miles km thanks large kwh battery pack charging technology equally cutting edge suv support kw dc fast charging percent top minutes inductive wireless charging system also offered home use letting owners recharge without cable blend immense performance cutting edge charging porsche advanced interior yet cayenne ev shaping one significant luxury suvs", "url": "", "tags": "PV & EV", "source_reliability": 0.5, "social_score": 0.0, "entities": "{\"entities\": [{\"text\": \"battery\", \"label\": \"COMPONENT\", \"start\": 1270, \"end\": 1277, \"confidence\": 0.6}, {\"text\": \"port\", \"label\": \"SUPPLYNODE\", \"start\": 339, \"end\": 343, \"confidence\": 0.55}]}", "events": "[]", "risk_labels": "[\"SupplyChain:Logistics\", \"Strategic:Sustainability\", \"Market:EV_Adoption\"]", "temporal_urgency": 0.7, "location_proximity": 1.0, "severity_0_10": 10.0}

In August, the company sold 34,236 units, representing an 11% year-on-year increase from 30,879 units in August 2024. August's domestic sales stood at 29,302 units with 4,934 units exported.</p>\n\n<p>Toyota's sustained growth reflects its strategic positioning in India's evolving automotive landscape. The company dominates India's hybrid vehicle segment, accounting for over 79% of hybrid sales in the country. This leadership in electrified mobility has become a key differentiator in a market increasingly focused on fuel efficiency and lower emissions.</p>\n\n<p>The company's hybrid portfolio, including the Innova HyCross, Urban Cruiser Hyryder, and Camry Hybrid, has resonated strongly with Indian consumers seeking alternatives to conventional petrol and diesel vehicles while avoiding range anxiety associated with pure electric vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Varinder Wadhwa, Vice President of Sales-Service-Used Car Business at TKM, attributed the positive sales trend to recent GST reforms and the onset of the festive season. &quot;Thanks to the landmark GST reforms by the Government of India and the onset of the festive season, market sentiments have been upbeat,&quot; Wadhwa said.</p>\n\n<p>The company has passed on the full benefits of the GST reduction to customers, resulting in price reductions across its vehicle range. These cuts, effective from September 22, range from ₹48,700 to ₹3.49 lakh across 11 models.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;With the festive season gathering momentum, we are confident of a strong performance ahead,&quot; Wadhwa added, emphasizing the company's priority of ensuring timely deliveries during the festive period. &quot;Right now, our foremost priority is to ensure timely deliveries so that customers can celebrate the festivities in their favourite Toyota, making this season truly special.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>September saw several key developments for TKM. The company introduced the new Rumion with enhanced safety features, making six airbags standard across all variants. This follows a similar move in August when TKM made six airbags standard on the Urban Cruiser Taisor, reflecting the company's increasing focus on safety across its portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>TKM also announced its association with DRUM TAO, Japan's internationally acclaimed performance group, as brand ambassadors, strengthening its cultural connect with customers.</p>\n\n<p>In August, the company had launched a special edition of the Camry Hybrid, adding to its product refresh initiatives ahead of the festive season.</p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Record FY2025 Performance Sets Foundation</span></h2>\n\n<p>The current year's growth builds on TKM's record-breaking FY2025 performance, when the company crossed the 300,000-unit milestone for the first time, selling 309,000 units. This represented the company's strongest annual performance since its inception in 1997.</p>\n\n<p>TKM operates two manufacturing plants in Bidadi, Karnataka, with a combined installed production capacity of up to 3,42,000 units annually. The first plant, established in 1997, produces models including the Innova HyCross, Innova Crysta, Fortuner, and Legender. The second plant, operational since 2010, manufactures the Camry Hybrid, Urban Cruiser Hyryder, and Hilux.</p>\n\n<p>The company's current product lineup also includes the Glanza, Rumion, and Urban Cruiser Taisor, while the Vellfire and LC 300 are imported as completely built units (CBU).</p>\n\n<p>TKM is a joint venture between Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan, which holds an 89% stake, and Kirloskar Systems Limited of India, with an 11% stake. The company employs over 6,500 people and operates from a 432-acre facility.</p>", "Published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 11:36:22", "Clean_summary": "toyota kirloskar motor tkm announced sales performance

As for those that have, the month saw strong dispatches for Mahindra, with the company reporting a record in terms of wholesales<a href=\"https://www.autocarpro.in/news/mahindra-breaks-two-auto-sales-records-in-september-128994\" target=\"_blank\"> at over 56,000 units</a>, much of it because of pent up demand from August. Similarly,&nbsp;Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) reported domestic wholesale sales of <a href=\"https://www.autocarpro.in/news/hyundai-india-posts-modest-shipment-recovery-in-september-128998\" target=\"_blank\">51,547 units in September</a> 2025, marking a marginal 0.9% increase over the 51,101 units sold in September 2024. The wholesale number also signals a 17% improvement from August's 44,001 units, suggesting that festive season demand is beginning to materialize at the dealer sales level.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #c0392b;\">Persisting Weakness</span></p>\n\n<p>The latest auto retail trends show a significant month-on-month decline in the sales of Hyundai in India, as there is an intense battle going on between Hyundai, Tata Motors and Mahindra to capture the number two position in the list of top car makers in India. Hyundai has been holding this position for the past decade; however, the rise in demand for homegrown passenger vehicles helped Mahindra and Tata to significantly increase their sales.</p>\n\n<p>The September performance represents a continuation of the volatility seen throughout 2025, where the traditional pecking order has been repeatedly challenged. Earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.autocarpro.in/analysis/no4-twice-in-a-row-whats-behind-hyundai-motor-indias-underperformance-125781\" target=\"_blank\">Mahindra outpaced both Hyundai Motor India</a> and Tata Motors to emerge as the second-highest PV seller in April 2025, registering a robust 25.1 per cent YoY growth.</p>\n\n<p>Tata Motors' strong showing in September, despite GST uncertainties, could be due to its dual approach with both internal combustion engine and electric vehicle offerings. Tata Motors compact cars including Nexon, Punch and Tiago are doing great business, as all three are offered with ICE and EV powertrains. The company is also preparing to reintroduce the iconic Sierra nameplate, which could further boost its market position.</p>\n\n<p>In the electric vehicle segment specifically, Tata continues to dominate with approximately 40.9% market share in the passenger EV space as of August 2025, demonstrating its successful early mover advantage in the electrification transition.</p>\n\n<p>Despite finishing third in September, Mahindra's performance remains impressive given its focused portfolio approach. Mahindra is currently selling only utility vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>For Hyundai Motor India, the September numbers represent continued challenges in maintaining its traditional second-place position. The company's 35,443 units mark a significant shift from its decade-long hold on the number two spot after market leader Maruti Suzuki.</p>\n\n<p>Hyundai Motor India clocked retail sales of 38,156 units in February, a dip compared with February last year, with the automaker's market share declining to 12.58 per cent last month as compared with 14.05 per cent market share in year-ago period.</p>\n\n<p>Despite strong performers like the Creta and Venue, Hyundai has struggled to maintain its momentum against increasingly competitive domestic manufacturers who have better adapted to evolving Indian consumer preferences.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Market Implications</span></p>\n\n<p>The September retail data underscores the fundamental shifts occurring in India's automotive landscape. The rise of domestic manufacturers like Tata and Mahindra reflects changing consumer preferences toward locally developed products that cater specifically to Indian market needs, from SUV body styles to affordable electric vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Industry experts note that this three-way competition for second place is likely to intensify further as all three manufacturers have significant product launches planned for the remainder of 2025 and early 2026. Tata's Sierra relaunch, Mahindra's expanding electric portfolio, and Hyundai's efforts to regain market share through new model introductions will keep the competition fierce.</p>\n\n<p>The battle for market position extends beyond mere bragging rights &ndash; it influences dealer confidence, consumer perception, and investment decisions. As the Indian automotive market continues its evolution toward electrification and SUV dominance, the company that best aligns with these trends while maintaining competitive pricing and strong dealer networks will likely emerge as the consistent number two player.</p>\n\n<p>With festival season sales data yet to be fully accounted for and new model launches on the horizon, the final quarter of 2025 promises to be crucial in determining whether this September reshuffling represents a temporary fluctuation or a more permanent realignment of India's automotive hierarchy.</p>", "Published":

The launch forms part of the company's &quot;Citro&euml;n 2.0 &ndash; Shift Into the New&quot; strategic initiative.</p>\n\n<p>The New Aircross X joins the recently launched Basalt X and C3X models in expanding Citro&euml;n's presence in the Indian SUV market. The vehicle is available in both 5-seater and 7-seater configurations.</p>\n\n<p>The SUV features several interior enhancements, including ventilated leatherette seats, a bezel-less 10.25-inch infotainment system, and a 7-inch digital cluster. The cabin includes soft-touch leatherette wrapping on the instrument panel with gold accents, diffused ambient lighting, and footwell lighting. A new &quot;Deep Forest Green&quot; color option has been added to the palette.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.autocarpro.in/autocarpro/1d1698c6-241b-4a9e-ab76-64dae16ede53_AircrossX-Interior_Beauty.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe vehicle offers 511 liters of boot space and maintains a 200mm ground clearance. Citro&euml;n's Advanced Comfort Suspension system is included across variants.</p>\n\n<p>A notable feature is CARA (Citro&euml;n Assistant with Remote Access), described as India's first multilingual, context-aware in-car companion. The system supports 52 languages and can switch between them mid-conversation. CARA provides voice-activated controls for vehicle functions, connectivity features including music and calls, and safety functions such as voice SOS and crash alerts.</p>\n\n<p>Other features include a HALO 360-degree camera with satellite view, Proxi-Sense passive entry and push start, cruise control, auto-dimming inside rearview mirror, and LED projector fog lamps.</p>\n\n<p>The Aircross 5S variant received a 5-star safety rating for adult protection in the Bharat New Car Assessment Program (BNCAP) earlier this week. Standard safety equipment includes six airbags, ESP, hill hold assist, ABS with EBD, and rear parking sensors across variants.</p>\n\n<p>The New Aircross X is offered with three powertrain options: a 1.2-liter naturally aspirated petrol engine (Puretech 82 MT), a 1.2-liter turbocharged petrol engine with manual transmission (Puretech 110 MT), and the same turbocharged engine with automatic transmission (Puretech 110 AT). A CNG option is available as a dealer-fitted accessory.</p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Pricing Structure</span></h2>\n\n<p>The pricing ranges from ₹8.29 lakh for the base YOU variant with the naturally aspirated engine to ₹13.49 lakh for the top-spec MAX AT variant. The HALO 360-degree camera is available as a mandatory accessory pack for ₹25,000 on the MAX variant, while dual-tone roof options cost an additional ₹20,000.</p>\n\n<p>CARA is offered complimentary on the MAX Automatic variant for initial bookings.</p>\n\n<p>Kumar Priyesh, Business Head and Director of Automotive Brands at Stellantis India, stated that the vehicle addresses the needs of Indian families for space, comfort, safety, and innovation while maintaining accessibility.</p>\n\n<h2><span style=\"color: #c0392b;\">Background</span></h2>\n\n<p>The Citro&euml;n Aircross X represents a critical inflection point for the French brand's troubled Indian journey, as Stellantis doubles down on a market that has become increasingly strategic given its limited access to other high-growth regions globally.</p>\n\n<p>However, Citro&euml;n's Indian operations have been marked by strategic missteps and poor product decisions, and the brand currently averages about 1% market share in India's competitive automotive landscape. It trails behind even other low-volume brands like Nissan India, Skoda India, and Renault India.</p>\n\n<p>The new X variant addresses some of the gaps in the earlier version, adding cruise control, a 360-degree camera, ventilated seats, and the Cara AI assistant that debuted on the Basalt X.</p>\n\n<p>The Aircross X launch is part of Citro&euml;n's broader &quot;2.0 strategy&quot; aimed at salvaging its Indian operations. Stellantis has set an immediate milestone of crossing 2,000 units in monthly sales while targeting a doubling of volumes by the end of FY26. The objective is clear: Citro&euml;n aims to at least double its market share within the next twelve months.</p>\n\n<p>Despite dismal sales performance, India holds outsized importance in Stellantis's global strategy as Stellantis faces headwinds elsewhere. The focus on India comes at a time when the world's fourth-largest carmaker is facing challenges in China, where it is reshuffling its strategy amid lagging sales and strong competition, and in Russia, where it has suspended production due to the Ukraine war. As CEO Carlos Tavares noted, &quot;The challenges... are giving India a bigger opportunity, even bigger than in the past&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>India forms a crucial part of Stellantis's &quot;Third Engine&quot; strategy &ndash; the aggregation of the South America, Middle East &amp; Africa and China and India &amp; Asia Pacific segments &ndash; aimed at diversifying revenue beyond North America and Europe. While Stellantis dominates South America with a 23.5% market share and plans to invest &euro;5.6 billion there through 2030, India represents untapped potential in a market where Chinese automakers are increasingly threatening Western brands' positions in other emerging economies.</p>\n\n<p>Critically, Citro&euml;n's Indian bet has strong backing from Stellantis headquarters, with a clear global target that by 2030, India should become the brand's second-largest market outside Europe. This ambitious goal requires immediate action on multiple fronts: expanding the dealer network from 80 to 150 touchpoints, improving after-sales service, and most importantly, offering products that actually meet Indian customer expectations.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the Aircross X represents both the promise and peril of Citro&euml;n's Indian journey. While the addition of long-overdue features shows the brand is finally listening to market feedback, success cannot be guaranteed. The Aircross X isn't just another variant launch &ndash; it's a test of whether Stellantis can transform its Indian operations from a profitable back-office into a genuine growth market, especially as Chinese competitors increasingly dominate other emerging markets where Western brands once held sway.</p>\n\n<p>For Stellantis, however, India's importance transcends Citro&euml;n's retail performance. As a manufacturing hub, export base, and potential hedge against challenges in China and Russia, India remains strategically vital. The Aircross X, priced competitively at ₹8.29 lakh, will reveal whether Citro&euml;n can finally crack the code of Indian consumer preferences.</p>", "Published": "Fri, 03 Oct 2025 12:33:23",

The milestone marks a 10% year-on-year growth compared to September 2024's sales of 51,062 units.</p>\n\n<p>The record performance propelled the company's overall auto sales, including exports, to 100,298 vehicles for the month, representing a 16% growth. With total UV sales including exports reaching 58,714 units, Mahindra demonstrated strong momentum across both domestic and international markets.</p>\n\n<p>The company's record-breaking performance came amid favorable market conditions created by the convergence of multiple factors. Nalinikanth Gollagunta, CEO of Mahindra's Automotive Division, highlighted the impact of GST 2.0 reforms and the timing of the Navratri festival, which fell in September this year compared to October last year.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Thanks to the impetus from GST 2.0 and the preceding weeks' pent-up demand, we have seen robust growth in dealer reported customer retails during the first nine days of Navratri, with over 60% growth in the SUV segment,&quot; Gollagunta stated in the company's announcement.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.autocarpro.in/autocarpro/47dd4ef4-fe34-42cd-bcf7-17fe01d7ef83_WhatsApp-Image-20251001-at-12.55.45.jpeg\" /></p>\n\n<p>The GST 2.0 reforms, implemented on September 22, 2025, reduced tax rates on small cars from 28% to 18%, eliminating the compensation cess. This development followed widespread speculation that prompted many prospective buyers to delay their purchases in the preceding weeks. The reforms affected compact SUVs with petrol engines up to 1,200cc and diesel engines up to 1,500cc, with vehicle lengths not exceeding 4,000mm. Mahindra passed on the full GST benefits to customers, with models in its lineup seeing price reductions exceeding Rs 1 lakh.</p>\n\n<p>October 2024 had marked Mahindra's previous monthly sales peak, when the company sold 54,504 SUVs domestically, representing a 25% year-on-year growth and total volumes of 96,648 vehicles. That performance was driven by models like the Scorpio-N and XUV700, as well as the recently launched Thar Roxx and updated XUV3XO, with September 2024 marking the first time Mahindra's monthly SUV sales had surpassed 50,000 units.</p>\n\n<p>Despite achieving record sales, Mahindra indicated that its performance could have been even stronger without logistical challenges. The company noted that billing numbers were subdued due to limited availability of trailers in the last 10 days of September, which constrained vehicle dispatches to dealers.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;The surge in festive demand has placed significant constraints on availability of trailers. We are working to improve dispatches to our dealer network within the constraints,&quot; Gollagunta said.</p>\n\n<p>The record September sales represent a sharp rebound from the subdued performance in August 2025, when major passenger vehicle manufacturers, including Mahindra, experienced sales declines. The trigger behind the August drop was widespread speculation that the government was evaluating slashing GST on small cars, leading many prospective buyers to delay their purchases while dealers cut back on stocking vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>The September figures confirm that this delayed demand materialized strongly once the reforms were implemented on September 22 and the festive season commenced. The early arrival of Navratri in September, combined with the tax benefits, contributed to the surge in retail activity during the month.</p>\n\n<h3><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Demand Concerns Persist</span></h3>\n\n<p>Despite the strong shipment data, largely influenced by a decision by Mahindra to shift shipments to September from August, other indicators point to persisting weak retail sales.</p>\n\n<p>According to Vahan retail data, for example, Tata Motors came in second in retail sales, outpacing both Mahindra &amp; Mahindra and Hyundai Motor India with 40,594 units sold, overtaking Mahindra's 37,015 units and Hyundai's 35,443 units.</p>\n\n<p>Back to shipments, for the fiscal year to date through September, Mahindra has sold 297,570 domestic passenger vehicles, up 14% compared to 260,210 units in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year. This sustained growth trajectory positions the company favorably for the remainder of the festive season.</p>\n\n<p>In September, Mahindra's commercial vehicles business also recorded strong growth, with domestic sales of 26,728 units representing an 18% increase. The light commercial vehicle segment (2T-3.5T category) grew 21% to 23,342 units, while three-wheelers, including electric variants, surged 30% to 13,017 units. Gollagunta noted that the CV segment also saw over 70% growth in dealer retails during the first nine days of Navratri compared to the same period last year.</p>\n\n<p>Export operations grew 43% to 4,320 vehicles in September, with year-to-date exports reaching 20,303 units, up 38% from 14,680 units in the corresponding period last year.</p>\n\n<p>Founded in 1945, Mahindra &amp; Mahindra is one of India's leading automotive manufacturers with a presence in utility vehicles, farm equipment, and commercial vehicles. The company is part of the Mahindra Group, which operates across more than 100 countries with approximately 260,000 employees globally.</p>", "Published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 11:17:40", "Clean_summary":

{"Source": "https://www.autocarpro.in/NEWS/hyundai-india-exports-up-44-128998", "Title": "Hyundai India Exports Up 44%", "Summary": "<div class=\"articleDetails_image\"><img src=\"https://img.autocarpro.in/autocarpro/6318ac38-56be-4204-a519-730e0038a867_whatsapp-image-20251001-at-12.40.25pm.jpeg?w=735&amp;h=485\" /></div><p>Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) reported domestic wholesale sales of 51,547 units in September 2025, marking a recovery from the subdued performance seen in recent months. While the figure represents only a marginal 0.9% increase over the 51,101 units sold in September 2024, it signals a 17% improvement from August's 44,001 units, suggesting that festive season demand is beginning to materialize.</p>\n\n<p>The September uptick comes as a relief for the South Korean automaker, which has struggled with domestic volumes through much of the current fiscal year. For the April-September 2025 period, Hyundai's cumulative domestic sales stood at approximately 3,32,386 units (based on April-August data of 2,80,839 units plus September's 51,547 units), indicating continued pressure in the home market.</p>\n\n<p>A month-by-month analysis of Hyundai's recent domestic performance reveals a challenging environment. After posting 44,001 units in August 2025, which itself was barely higher than July's 43,973 units (an increase of just 28 vehicles), the September figure of 51,547 units represents the strongest monthly showing since the fiscal year began in April.&nbsp;The company, meanwhile, was keen to highlight that September sales were up sharply from August's 44,001 units.</p>\n\n<p>It also pointed to a strong performance in exports, which are at a 33-month high. Exports surged 44% YoY to 18,800 units, marking the highest monthly exports since Dec 2022. Cumulatively, Apr&ndash;Sep exports rose 17% YoY to 99,540 units, reinforcing India as Hyundai&rsquo;s global export and manufacturing hub.</p>\n\n<p>This export strength has helped Hyundai maintain overall volumes, with total sales (domestic plus exports) reaching 70,347 units in September, up 10% year-on-year. However, for a company that has historically derived the bulk of its volumes from the domestic market, the export surge serves more as a cushion than a solution to the core challenge of reviving home market sales.</p>\n\n<h3>GST Boost</h3>\n\n<p>The company now expects strong tailwinds from the recent cut in GST. &quot;We extend our sincere gratitude to the Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri. Narendra Modi Ji for the transformative GST 2.0 reforms, which have given wings to the aspirations of millions of people around the country,&quot; Garg said.</p>\n\n<p>According to an official, HMIL is witnessing a &quot;synergetic alignment of domestic + export growth&quot; which could lead to &ldquo;double-engine growth&rdquo; in coming months.</p>\n\n<p>The GST reduction has made vehicles more affordable just as the crucial festive season approaches. In India's automotive market, September through November typically accounts for a significant portion of annual sales as consumers make purchases around Diwali and other major festivals. Dealers stock up during this period, driving wholesale numbers higher.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The question now is whether this September recovery represents a sustained turnaround or merely a temporary festive bump.</p>\n\n<h3>Soft Demand</h3>\n\n<p>As in case of rivals such as Tata, Hyundai has been hit by slow demand in recent months. The year-on-year growth of less than 1% in September&mdash;despite the GST benefits and festive demand&mdash;suggests underlying challenges persist. Moreover, retail numbers sourced from Vahan database seem to indicate <a href=\"https://www.autocarpro.in/news/tata-motors-rises-to-no2-in-vahan-auto-sales-data-for-september-2025-128997\">continued weakness</a> for Hyundai.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is in addition to some slippage in its market share over the last several quarters. According to industry data, the company's share of the Indian passenger vehicle market fell to 13.8% in FY2025, down 80 basis points from 14.6% in FY2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The competitive landscape has intensified significantly, with Hyundai facing pressure from multiple directions. Mahindra &amp; Mahindra has emerged as a formidable challenger, growing its market share from 10.9% in FY2024 to 12.7% in FY2025. Tata Motors, holding a 13.1% share, remains another close competitor.</p>\n\n<p>In March 2025, Hyundai managed to reclaim the No. 2 position in the Indian market from Tata Motors, but by a razor-thin margin of just 204 vehicles. At one time, the company used to enjoy a comfortable cushion in the runner-up spot it has traditionally occupied behind market leader Maruti Suzuki.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Maruti Suzuki continues to dominate with a 40.6% market share, though even the market leader has seen its share decline from 41.8% in FY2024.</p>\n\n<p>Like in case of Mahindra and Tata, September's 17% jump from August's wholesale levels provides some reassurance, but whether this represents a genuine inflection point or simply normal festive season stocking by dealers remains to be seen. October and November numbers will be critical in determining if Hyundai has truly turned the corner.</p>\n\n<h3>Product Mix Shift Underway</h3>\n\n<p>While overall domestic volumes have been under pressure, Hyundai has been shifting its product mix significantly toward SUVs. In September, SUVs accounted for 72.4% of domestic sales&mdash;37,313 units out of 51,547 total units. This represents the highest SUV penetration in the company's history in India.</p>\n\n<p>The Creta mid-size SUV recorded its best-ever monthly sales of 18,861 units, while the Venue compact SUV posted 11,484 units&mdash;its highest monthly tally in 20 months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The flip side is weakness in sedans and hatchbacks. Hyundai's market share in the sedan segment have fallen, offsetting SUV gains, resulting in the flat overall domestic performance.</p>\n\n<p>The September recovery suggests that consumer sentiment is improving, and the GST reforms should provide additional stimulus. However, Hyundai will need to sustain month-on-month growth through the festive season to make up for the weak April-August performance and avoid a second consecutive year of domestic volume decline.</p>", "Published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 12:39:17", "Clean_summary": "hyundai motor india limited hmil reported domestic wholesale sales units september marking recovery subdued performance seen

This new SUV will be Nissan&rsquo;s most important launches for India in recent years. The Nissan C-SUV will go on sale by mid-2026, followed later by a three-row version by late-2026 to rival the likes of the Hyundai Alcazar and Tata Safari.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>The new Nissan C-SUV will share its CMF-B foundations with the upcoming Renault Duster, courtesy of the Renault-Nissan Alliance&rsquo;s common platform strategy. However, Nissan has previewed earlier that its SUV will wear a design of its own. The Nissan SUV gets unique front fascia with its own design identity seen on headlamp units, horizontal daytime-running lamps, and a wide grille with horizontal slats all helping it set itself apart from its Renault sibling.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>Nissan is yet to reveal exact specifications, however we can confirm that the SUV is expected to debut with one or more petrol engine options. Alternative fuel options such as CNG and ethanol-based powertrains for future models are also being evaluated. &nbsp;Unfortunately, there will be no diesel engine on offer.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>This new SUV is a make-or-break product for Nissan India, which currently has a very limited line-up &ndash; the Magnite being the only locally manufactured model on sale. By entering the hotly contested midsize SUV segment, Nissan will once again find itself up against established players like the Hyundai Creta, Kia Seltos, Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara, Toyota Urban Cruiser Hyryder and Honda Elevate.</span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span>While Nissan hasn&rsquo;t yet revealed what it will be called, we are told that the SUV will have a unique brand identity which will be unique to India. The October 7 design reveal should finally give us a clearer idea of how Nissan intends to carve its own niche in this crowded segment.&nbsp; A seven-seat derivative, due in 2027 is already under development to help Nissan broaden its portfolio in the midsize SUV space.&nbsp;</span></span></p>", "Published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 14:37:34", "Clean_summary": "nissan gearing pull covers new c segment suv october previewing final design ahead global debut new suv nissan important launches india recent years nissan c suv go sale mid followed later three row version late rival likes hyundai alcazar tata safari new nissan c suv share cmf b foundations upcoming renault duster courtesy renault nissan alliance common platform strategy however nissan previewed earlier suv wear design nissan suv gets unique front fascia design identity seen headlamp units horizontal daytime running lamps wide grille horizontal slats helping set apart renault sibling nissan yet reveal exact specifications however confirm suv expected debut one petrol engine options alternative fuel options cng ethanol based powertrains future models also evaluated unfortunately diesel engine offer new suv make break product nissan india currently limited line magnite locally manufactured model sale entering hotly contested midsize suv segment nissan find established players like hyundai creta kia seltos maruti suzuki grand vitara toyota urban cruiser hyryder honda elevate nissan yet revealed called told suv unique brand identity unique india october design reveal finally give us clearer idea nissan intends carve niche crowded segment seven seat derivative due already development help nissan broaden portfolio midsize suv space", "Category": "PV & EV", "risk_score": 0.2, "risk_flag": 0, "id": "2678cac28429c3270b8dc30f2fd75acab653a7be", "source": "https://www.autocarpro.in/NEWS/nissan-c-suv-design-details-to-be-revealed-on-october-7-129008", "published_at": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 14:37:34", "title": "Nissan C-SUV design details to be revealed on October 7", "text": "nissan gearing pull covers new c segment suv october previewing final design ahead global debut new suv nissan important launches india recent years nissan c suv go sale mid followed later three row version late rival likes hyundai alcazar tata safari new nissan c suv share cmf b foundations upcoming renault duster courtesy renault nissan alliance common platform strategy however nissan previewed earlier suv wear design nissan suv gets unique front fascia design identity seen headlamp units horizontal daytime running lamps wide grille horizontal slats helping set apart renault sibling nissan yet reveal exact specifications however confirm suv expected debut one petrol engine options alternative fuel options cng ethanol based powertrains future models also evaluated unfortunately diesel engine offer new suv make break product nissan india currently limited line magnite locally manufactured model sale entering hotly contested midsize suv segment nissan find established players like hyundai creta kia seltos maruti suzuki grand vitara toyota urban cruiser hyryder honda elevate nissan yet revealed called told suv unique brand identity unique india october design reveal finally give us clearer idea nissan intends carve niche crowded segment seven seat derivative due already development help nissan broaden portfolio midsize suv space", "url": "", "tags": "PV & EV", "source_reliability": 0.5, "social_score": 0.0, "entities": "{\"entities\": [{\"text\": \"port\", \"label\": \"SUPPLYNODE\", \"start\": 113, \"end\": 117, \"confidence\": 0.55}]}", "events": "[]", "risk_labels": "[\"SupplyChain:Logistics\", \"Market:EV_Adoption\"]", "temporal_urgency": 0.7, "location_proximity": 1.0, "severity_0_10": 10.0}

In September, the company delivered its one millionth plug-in hybrid, 13 years after it launched its first PHEV.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The company is transitioning towards becoming a fully electrified car maker, with plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) a significant pillar of the company&rsquo;s growth today. PHEVs made up 23% of Volvo Cars&rsquo; global sales in the first half of 2025. PHEV sales grew from almost 46,000 units in 2019 to over 177,000 units in 2024, underpinned by strong demand for the XC60 and XC90 PHEV in all three main sales regions.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The XC60 was the best-selling PHEV in Europe in 2024 and led the premium PHEV segment globally in the last three years. It continues to be a segment leader in 2025. Both the XC60 and XC90 were renewed last year, reinforcing their appeal in key markets such as Sweden, the US and China. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">According to the company, as a result of the robust demand for its PHEVs, Volvo Cars has the highest share of PHEV sales of its total sales among all legacy premium car makers. It also continues to roll out new PHEVs, as demonstrated by the recently launched XC70 SUV, which is Volvo Cars&rsquo; first long-range plug-in hybrid with an electric range of over 200 kilometres under the CLTC testing cycle.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Internal Volvo Cars data shows that its PHEVs are often used as if they were fully electric, especially in urban areas. On average, drivers of Volvo PHEVs use their car without internal combustion power for around half of total driving time.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Volvo Cars launched its first PHEV already in 2012, when it started selling a diesel PHEV variant of the V60 estate. For several years after, it was the only global car maker that offered a PHEV version of every model in its line-up. It currently offers PHEV variants on five different models, which complement a line-up of six fully electric models.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>ALSO READ:</strong></span></span></span><span><span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> </span></span></span><a href=\"https://www.autocarpro.in/news/bev-sales-in-europe-jump-27-to-159746-units-in-august-128871\" style=\"text-decoration: none;\"><span><span><span style=\"color: #0563c1;\"><strong><u>BEV sales in Europe jump 27% to 159,746 units in August</u></strong></span></span></span></a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>", "Published": "Fri, 03 Oct 2025 10:25:56", "Clean_summary": "volvo cars reached important milestone electrification journey september company delivered one millionth plug hybrid years launched first phev company transitioning towards becoming fully electrified car maker plug hybrids phevs significant pillar company growth today phevs made volvo cars global sales first half phev sales grew almost units units underpinned strong demand xc xc phev three main sales regions xc best selling phev europe led premium phev segment globally last three years continues segment leader xc xc renewed last year reinforcing appeal key markets sweden us china according company result robust demand phevs volvo cars highest share phev sales total sales among legacy premium car makers also continues roll new phevs demonstrated recently launched xc suv volvo cars first long range plug hybrid electric range kilometres cltc testing cycle internal volvo cars data shows phevs often used fully electric especially urban areas average drivers volvo phevs use car without internal combustion power around half total driving time volvo cars launched first phev already started selling diesel phev variant v estate several years global car maker offered phev version every model line currently offers phev variants five different models complement line six fully electric models also read bev sales europe jump units august", "Category": "PV & EV", "risk_score": 0.4, "risk_flag": 1, "id": "9cdb59fe1df39d7691ccba617253e9ea95b6568f", "source": "https://www.autocarpro.in/NEWS/volvo-delivers-its-one-millionth-plug-in-hybrid-129043", "published_at": "Fri, 03 Oct 2025 10:25:56", "title": "Volvo delivers its one-millionth plug-in hybrid", "text": "volvo cars reached important milestone electrification journey september company delivered one millionth plug hybrid years launched first phev company transitioning towards becoming fully electrified car maker plug hybrids phevs significant pillar company growth today phevs made volvo cars global sales first half phev sales grew almost units units underpinned strong demand xc xc phev three main sales regions xc best selling phev europe led premium phev segment globally last three years continues segment leader xc xc renewed last year reinforcing appeal key markets sweden us china according company result robust demand phevs volvo cars highest share phev sales total sales among legacy premium car makers also continues roll new phevs demonstrated recently launched xc suv volvo cars first long range plug hybrid electric range kilometres cltc testing cycle internal volvo cars data shows phevs often used fully electric especially urban areas average drivers volvo phevs use car without internal combustion power around half total driving time volvo cars launched first phev already started selling diesel phev variant v estate several years global car maker offered phev version every model line currently offers phev variants five different models complement line six fully electric models also read bev sales europe jump units august", "url": "", "tags": "PV & EV", "source_reliability": 0.5, "social_score": 0.0, "entities": "{\"entities\": [{\"text\": \"port\", \"label\": \"SUPPLYNODE\", \"start\": 21, \"end\": 25, \"confidence\": 0.55}]}", "events": "[]", "risk_labels": "[\"SupplyChain:Logistics\", \"Market:EV_Adoption\"]", "temporal_urgency": 0.7, "location_proximity": 0.6, "severity_0_10": 10.0}

Since bookings commenced, the Creta-rival has already gathered <span>25,000 orders.</span> Current waiting periods stand at around <span>10 weeks</span>, and even with production running at full capacity, according to Maruti Suzuki. Dealers expect lead times to hover between two and three months in the near future for the <a href=\"https://www.autocarpro.in/news/maruti-victrois-gets-5-star-bncap-crash-test-rating-128398\"><strong>Victoris</strong></a> that also has a five-star crash test rating.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>The Victoris&rsquo; early success can be attributed to a combination of factors. Aggressive pricing has placed it squarely in the sweet spot of the midsize SUV segment, while the recent <span>GST 2.0 slab cuts</span> have further sweetened the deal. Add to this, Maruti&rsquo;s reach through its vast Arena dealer network has also given the model a wider audience compared to some rivals including Maruti&rsquo;s own Grand Vitara which is restricted to a lesser number of &ldquo;premium&rdquo; outlets.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>Maruti has equipped the <a href=\"https://www.autocarpro.in/news/maruti-suzuki-announces-pricing-for-new-victoris-suv-starting-at-%E2%82%B91049-lakh-128660\"><strong>Victoris </strong></a>with a comprehensive list of features to ensure it stays competitive. The SUV gets a large touchscreen infotainment system with wireless smartphone connectivity, a fully digital driver&rsquo;s display, connected car tech, ventilated seats, wireless charging, panoramic sunroof, and a premium audio setup. On the safety front, it comes with six airbags, ESP, ABS with EBD, hill-hold assist and a 360-degree camera on higher trims. The SUV has many segment leading features which are missing even on the more premium Grand Vitara SUV. </span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>Powertrain choices</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>Under the hood, the Victoris is offered with multiple engine options. The range begins with Maruti&rsquo;s tried-and-tested <span>1.5-litre naturally aspirated petrol</span>, paired with manual and automatic gearbox choices. Higher trims get a <span>1.5-litre strong-hybrid option</span>, developed with Toyota, which promises segment-leading efficiency figures. There&rsquo;s also a CNG variant on the cards for cost-conscious buyers, further expanding the Victoris&rsquo; appeal in smaller cities and fleet markets.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>The midsize SUV segment is one of the hottest battlegrounds in the Indian car market today.

New car buyers looking at the brand&rsquo;s three-model line-up, that includes the Tiguan, Taigun and Virtus, &nbsp;can now avail themselves of hefty cash discounts, exchange or scrappage bonuses, and loyalty benefits depending on the model. While the exact figures will vary, the headline offers run as high as Rs 3 lakh on certain models, giving buyers a chance to make considerable savings at a time when demand is already buoyant thanks to the GST 2.0 slab revisions.<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.autocarpro.in/autocarpro/4c6d6d27-58c6-4632-817b-dc2b3350421e_VDX2.avif\" /><br />\nThe biggest savings are being offered on Volkswagen&rsquo;s current flagship, the Tiguan. Brought to India around six months ago as a full CBU import, the SUV is available in a single R Line variant at Rs 49 lakh. The model recently became more competitive in terms of pricing, thanks to the GST revisions that brought down its sticker price by a notable Rs 3.27 lakh. For the month of October, Volkswagen has sweetened the deal further by offering up to Rs 3 lakh in benefits, effectively taking the Tiguan&rsquo;s price down by over ₹6 lakh when both schemes are combined. That makes the German brand&rsquo;s sole premium SUV a far more attractive proposition for buyers considering it against rivals in the full-size SUV space.</span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>The midsize Creta rivaling Taigun SUV, Volkswagen&rsquo;s highest-volume model in India, is also being offered with a wide spread of festive discounts. Depending on model year and trim, buyers can save up to Rs 2 lakh on the SUV, making it one of the most aggressive offers from Volkswagen this season. Special prices on select unsold 2024 stock mean the entry-level Taigun Comfortline 1.0 TSI manual variant can now be had from just over Rs 10.5 lakh, while Highline trims are being offered in the Rs 11.9&ndash;12.9 lakh range. Even the top-spec Taigun 1.5 TSI GT Plus variants are seeing substantial benefits, with the Taigun Chrome edition of the 2024 batch carrying savings of up to Rs 1.95 lakh. For those preferring the sportier GT Plus Sport variant, which brings blacked-out wheels and trim, the festive benefits extend up to Rs 1.55 lakh. Volkswagen has even included discounts on some of the 2025 model year stock, albeit slightly lower than the outgoing units, with cuts of just over Rs 1 lakh on select trims.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://img.autocarpro.in/autocarpro/28ff00d2-7c81-47cb-bafb-04e8acc793c8_VDX3.avif\" /></span></span></span></span></p>\n\n<p><span><span><span><span>The Honda City rivaling Virtus midsize sedan, meanwhile, rounds off the Volkswagen range with attractive offers of its own. The biggest benefits are reserved for the 1.0 TSI Highline variant, which sees discounts as high as Rs1.56 lakh. The Virtus Topline sits just behind with a maximum benefit of Rs 1.5 lakh. While other 1.0 TSI variants are being offered with smaller benefits in the range of Rs 50,000, it&rsquo;s the higher-performance 1.5 TSI GT Plus models that see mixed levels of festive relief. Buyers opting for the GT Plus Chrome or Sport versions equipped with the DSG dual-clutch automatic can avail of savings up to Rs 90,000, while those preferring the manual gearbox see benefits capped at around Rs 50,000.<br />\n<br />\nIt&rsquo;s worth noting that these benefits are not uniform across the country and is heavily dependent on dealer-level inventory. With certain 2024 stock still available at attractive prices, buyers may find better deals on unsold units compared to fresh 2025 production batches. As always, availability will dictate the exact quantum of discounts, hence it is advisable to prospective buyers to check with their nearest dealer for precise figures.</span></span></span></span></p>", "Published": "Fri, 03 Oct 2025 16:21:53", "Clean_summary": "volkswagen kicked festive season round significant discounts across model range new car buyers
